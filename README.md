# ME310 Project Repository

Welcome to the ME310 Project Repository! This repository is dedicated to housing the source code and resources for our interdisciplinary project. Our project focuses on creating innovative solutions through the integration of technology and design principles.

## Overview

The repository contains several key Python scripts and a directory for Teensy microcontroller code, aimed at facilitating our project's development. These scripts are designed to work together to achieve the project's goals, including controlling hardware components, handling MQTT messages, and managing video feeds.

### Key Components

- `Controller.py`: Manages the main control flow of the project, coordinating between different modules.
- `Mqtt.py`: Handles MQTT messaging for real-time communication between devices.
- `camsv.html` and `camsv.py`: Work together to facilitate video streaming services.
- `cpp.py`: Contains utility functions used across the project.
- `main.py`: The entry point of the project, initializing and starting the main application.
- `video_feed.cpp`: A C++ file dedicated to managing video feed processing.

### Teensy Folder

The `teensy` folder contains code specifically for the Teensy microcontroller, which is utilized in this project for its high-performance hardware control capabilities.
